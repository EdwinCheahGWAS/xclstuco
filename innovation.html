      <p class="event_description">Innovation Week was an eventful series of workshops that introduced the students of XCL World Academy to a world of STEM and computer sciences. Taking place from the 28th to 30th of March, students attended Sonic Pi, Apple Swift Learning, and Teachable Machine workshops and took away valuable skills as well as goodies! (T-shirts, stickers, badges) Innovation Week ended off with Maker Night, an after school event in which students made projects with the guidance of workshops teaching how to make in Python and Minecraft! Students also participated in an Innovation Challenge, in which they prepared a pitch to present to a panel of qualified judges to compete for trophies.</p>
